# Hello-World
Getting My Feet Wet

Hi, my name is Stuart and I'm learning how Github works.  I am an electrical engineer by training with a strong background in applied physics and material science.  I am very interested in doing data science and need to brush up on my coding.  I have experience with C++, , C#, Java, and Python.  I'm hoping to learn a lot from the coding community that calls Github home for so much of what they do.
